# ReactXSpringboot
the is a project to refamiliarize myself with React, and How to integrate it into a Springboot backend.

it follows this guide: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/06/17/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot
I followed along and documented the code after writing it to ensure that I thoroughly understood the function of each part.

to run: run "run.py". React frontend will load right away, it will take a few seconds for Springboot backend to set up.
to stop: keyboard interrupt on "run.py" will shut down both processes.
